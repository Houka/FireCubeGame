There are 3 layers to choose from at the top
1. background
2. terrain

    - click on a tile with nothing selected to see details
    - use the box on the left labeled "zone" to assign zone IDs to tiles
        - each tile can have multiple zones
        - like all black boxes with white numbers, you can change the value (see below)
        - highlighting the zone button will outline all tiles with that zone

        - click on the object you wish to see details for
        - click the black boxes you wish to edit
        - all fields except aggro range expect (1-99)
        - time represents number of tenths of a second (54 = 5.4seconds)
        - range represents number of tenths of tile away (54 = 5.4 tiles distance)
        - eneimes with aggrozone or patrolzone should have a number that corresponds to tiles assigned in the terrain layer
