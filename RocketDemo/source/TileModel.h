//  This encapsulates all of the information for representing a crate. Since crates only
//  move under their own power, we normally would not need a separate class (because we
//  could just use an instance of BoxObstacle).  However, this changes when we do dynamic
//  level loading.
//
//  The problem is that we need to initialize an physics object when a level is loaded,
//  but NOT attach any assets yet.  That is because the physics object is itself an asset
//  and it is not safe to assume the order of asset loading.  So instead, we just store
//  the keys of the assets in this class, and they attach the assets later when we
//  initialize the scene graph.
